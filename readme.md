# Chatbot Project Build32

## Description
This project is a chatbot that integrates various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It's designed to showcase tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, vector space language models, deeper language representations, sequence-to-sequence translation, pattern matching, and text generation.

## Project Structure
The chatbot is organized into several modules, each handling a specific aspect of NLP:

- `nlp_utils/`: Contains modules for text preprocessing (tokenization, stemming, lemmatization), vectorization, and word embeddings.
- `seq2seq/`: Houses the sequence-to-sequence translation model.
- `pattern_matching/`: For pattern matching utilities.
- `text_generation/`: Responsible for generating natural language text.

The `main.py` file serves as the entry point for the chatbot.

## Setup
To run this chatbot, you will need Python installed on your system along with several libraries. Here's how to set it up:

1. **Clone the Repository**

git clone <repository-url>
cd chatbot

2. **Install Dependencies**
Install the necessary Python libraries:

pip install nltk gensim scikit-learn

3. **Download NLTK Data**
Run Python and download the required NLTK datasets:

python -m nltk.downloader punkt wordnet

## Running the Chatbot
To run the chatbot, execute the `main.py` script from the command line:

python main.py

Enter your message when prompted, and the chatbot will process your input using its NLP modules.

## Extending the Chatbot
This project is modular, so you can easily expand its capabilities. For instance, you could integrate a more sophisticated sequence-to-sequence model in `seq2seq/translator.py`, or enhance the pattern matching capabilities in `pattern_matching/matcher.py`.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs!

Note: This chatbot is a prototype and serves as an example of various NLP techniques. For a production-level application, further development and testing would be required.
